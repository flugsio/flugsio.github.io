yay me. tl;dr: `new Blog().save`

about blogging
--------------

I've been thinking about writing a blog for a long time.
One of the reasons I kept postponing it
was because I though that it wouldn't be useful.
Was there something that I could contribute,
something that someone not already had written about?

I used to think that there wasn't.
And if I had some information that could aid someone,
I thought it would be better to fix it at the source.

For example if there was an weird error message from a compiler,
then the obvious thing was to either fix the compiler message
or make a bug report.
A tracker would be a good place to collect workarounds,
and it would be as searchable as a blog post.

Example code could be inluded in the documentation,
and so on.

convinced
---------

What I've realized,
is that sometimes there is no good place for some information.
Maybe related to a closed source project without a public bug tracker,
or it may not even be related to coding.

I rarely use close source software,
and writing about personal haven't felt that important.

But I realised that a blog is a good place
to document thoughs and experiences.
To shine some light on real world usages of code/products to spark interest,
showing gluecode instead of nonsense minimal examples
for a single function used in isolation.


progress
--------

I have tried blogging in the past,
but has always failed to keep it going.

I don't not have high hopes
of keeping this blog alive.
I like writing,
but most of the time I don't not feel satisfied
and tend to erase sentence after sentence.

Every post is progress,
although I don't really know to what end.

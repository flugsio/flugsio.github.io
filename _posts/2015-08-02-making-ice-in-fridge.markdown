I actually own a freezer,
but I keep it turned of
because don't have anything to put in it!
But I would like to have ice available,
especially in the summer.
Using it for this one and only purpose feels wasteful though.

I do have a fridge which is mostly empty.
If possible I wouldn't have that turned on either,
but it's needed for some medical supplies.
Searching the net for tips on how to make ice in a fridge
didn't give me anything useful,
the results was mostly about built-in icemakers.

I decided to just experiment with random containers,
and forthwith found a solution that worked.
I just piled up an loaf pan sideways against the freezer wall.
I haven't timed it, but it seems to make ice in about 12 hours.
